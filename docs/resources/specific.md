# Popular and Useful Resources
Much of coding is just practice. The more you code the better you become,
simple enough right? Unfortunately sometimes it is hard to determine where to
start. Here are a list of resources you may find useful. Feel free to chime in
with others!

## Unix
Unlike the rest, there are not online interactive resources for learning Unix
commands. I strongly suggest, you do not ignore learning some of these commands.
You can do some incredibly powerful things straight from the command line. Here
are just a few resources.

1. [Unix Cheat Sheet](http://www.cheat-sheets.org/saved-copy/fwunixref.pdf)
2. [Unix Tutorial for Beginners](http://acad.coloradocollege.edu/dept/pc/SciCompLab/UnixTutorial/)
3. [Introduction to Unix Commands](https://kb.iu.edu/d/afsk)
4. [basic unix Commands](http://mally.stanford.edu/~sr/computing/basic-unix.html)

## Git
### GitHub Tutorial
[GitHub Tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) walks you through
the steps of initializing git repositories to pushing commits and creating branches.
Most everything you will do that is related to git is contained in this tutorial.

### Code School - Git Path
[Code School - Git Path](https://www.codeschool.com/paths/git) will take you
from beginner to advanced git commands. It also ties in usage through GitHub.

### Git Immersion
[Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) walks you through setting up your config
settings all the way to getting your code online.

### Other Resources

1. [Git Documentation](http://git-scm.com/doc)
2. [GitHub's List](https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/)
3. [Atlassin (BitBucket) Tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials)
## Python
### LearnPython.org
[LearnPython.org](http://www.learnpython.org/) has an interactive shell you can
input code into as you progress through the tutorials.

### Codecademy
[Codecademy - Python Track](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python) takes
you through beginner Python. It too has an interactive console you can use on
their site.

### Learn Python The Hard Way
Learn by doing, thats it. [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/index.html) is a very useful book full of concepts implemented by examples.
This book will only be effective if you actually right the code and not skim
over it.

### Other Python Resources

1. [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/2.7/)
2. [Reddit Learn Python](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython)
3. [Programmers Stack Exchange](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/12189/how-do-i-learn-python-from-zero-to-web-development)

## R
### Coursera - R Programming
[R Programming](https://www.coursera.org/course/rprog) is a short course offered
through Coursera. It may or may not be available, but it is often taught during
the year.

### Code School - Try R
[Code School - Try R](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-r) offers a
basic introduction to R interactively online.

### DataCamp - Intro to R
[DataCamp - Intro to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-r) is
another online interactive R service. It covers the basics to lists.


### Other R Resources

1. [R Documentation](http://www.r-project.org/other-docs.html)
2. [r-dir list](http://r-dir.com/learn/courses.html)
3. [Useful R links - Stack Exchange](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/138/resources-for-learning-r)

## Bioinformatics
Sometimes most of these tutorials are very technical and boring. Often times
the examples are uninteresting. Wouldn't you like some common bioinformatic
problems to solve? If yes, then I suggest you check out [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/)!

### Rosalind
[Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/) is a useful site with a number
of biology related problems. The problems range from extremely easy counting
nucleotides to difficult local alignment algorithms. Check it out!
