# Use the EIGC server!!!
The biggest suggestion we can make is to always use the EIGC server when using
Git, Python, running tools, writing code, etc... Everything you will need is
already setup on the server. As the class advances we are likely to begin
running some intese programs, so put that stress on the server and not your
local machine!

## What is a shell/terminal? Text editor? SSH? SFTP?
### Shells/Terminals
The term shell and terminal are sometimes used interchangeably. Basically the
terminal is a program that launches a shell that allows you to type in
commands to be executed by the computer. At the beginning the terminal may
just be a blackbox to you, but by the end of the class the terminal is going
to be your best friend! Its very powerfull and essential to most everything
you will do in this class. Get comfortable with it!

There are a number of shells (sh, bash, ksh, zsh, etc...) to choose from, bash
is a good one to start with.

### Text Editors
These are pretty self explanatory, programs that allow you to edit text.
Simple enough right? Well, it depends where you are editing a file from. Is it
in the terminal or with a local program? If you are in the terminal, don't
expect a graphical user interface (GUI) so they can be tough at first but you
will need to be comfortable with at least one. There are a number of non-GUI
text editors, including vi, vim, emacs, and nano. Best advice, pick one and
stick with it!

Text editors with a GUI will be suggested below, based on the operating system.

### SSH
The Secure Shell protocol (SSH) allows you to securely login onto remote
servers. This is done use the program aptly named *ssh*!

### SFTP
SSH File Transfer Protocol, or SFTP, allows you to create a secure connection
with a remote server and transfer files. SFTP can be run through the terminal
or GUI based programs.

## Mac Environment
Most everything we do in this class you could do locally on your Mac. Git and
Python come installed by default, and R and RStudio are easy to setup (not
documented here). But at the end of the day you can save yourself some time by
using the EIGC server. Another thing to keep in mind, if something doesn't
work on the EIGC server you can let an admin know and it will get fixed! On
your Mac, you can probably get help but otherwise will be on your own.

### Suggested Terminals

* Terminal (It's native to Mac, so you already have it!)
* [iTerm2](http://iterm2.com/#/section/home)
* [Terminator](https://code.google.com/p/jessies/)

### Suggested Text Editors

* [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3)
* [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/)
* [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)
* [TextMate 2](http://macromates.com/download)

### Suggested SFTP Tools

* [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)
* [CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io/?l=en)

## Windows Environment
Speaking from experience, working with Windows locally is an uphill battle
with most of the things we will do in this class. You will quickly find that
having to install Python, Git, random Git GUI (if needed), R and Rstudio, is
a rather tedious process. With enough perseverance and luck it is definitely
possible, but again why do that to yourself when we have a server set up with
everything that you will need!

### Suggested Terminals
* [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)
* [CygWin](https://www.cygwin.com/)
* [Secure Shell (Google Chrome App)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell/pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo?hl=en)

### Suggested Text Editors

* [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/)

### Suggested SFTP Tools

* [WinSCP](http://winscp.net/eng/download.php)
* [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)

## Linux Environment
If you are using Linux, you likely don't need help setting up!
